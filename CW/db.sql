These rivalry games can end up closer than expected, one of the NFL betting trends to keep in mind when making your Week 12 NFL bets. Packers vs. 49ers (+3, 46.5) will take place on Sunday, and 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy has been limited in practice all week with a shoulder injury, putting his status in doubt. However, San Francisco could get tight end George Kittle back from a hamstring injury. There\'s another type of rivalry that will take place on Monday Night Football, a sibling rivalry. The Harbaughs will be on opposing sidelines, as the Ravens are three-point favorites over the Chargers in the Week 12 NFL odds, one of the slimmest NFL spreads of the week. The over-under for that game is 51, up four from the opener. John and Jim Harbaugh have faced off twice before, including infamously in Super Bowl XLVII. John\'s Ravens won and covered in both previous encounters. Should what happened over a decade ago affect your Week 12 NFL predictions? All of the updated Week 12 NFL lines are listed below, and SportsLine\'s advanced computer model has all the NFL betting advice and NFL predictions you need to make the best Week 12 NFL picks now. The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up well over $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model entered Week 12 of the 2024 NFL season on an incredible 20-8 betting hot streak on top-rated NFL picks this year. Longer term, it is on a 200-136 roll on top-rated NFL picks that dates back to the 2017 season and a 54-29 roll on top-rated NFL picks since Week 7 of 2022. The model also ranked in the top 10 on NFLPickWatch four of the past six years on straight-up NFL picks and beat more than 94% of CBS Sports Football Pick\'em players four times during that span. Anyone following at sportsbooks and on betting apps has seen strong returns. Now, it has turned its attention to the latest Week 12 NFL odds and NFL betting lines and locked in betting picks for every NFL matchup. Head here to see every pick. Top Week 12 NFL predictions We can tell you one of the model\'s strongest Week 12 NFL picks is that the Bears (+3.5, 39.5) cover the spread at home versus the Vikings. No team has a better spread record versus the Bears at home (4-1), and this isn\'t a one-year thing. Chicago has the best against-the-spread home record (8-3-2) since the start of last season. Meanwhile, the Vikings have failed to cover in two of their last three road games. Additionally, after starting the year a perfect 5-0 against the spread (ATS), the Vikings are just 2-3 ATS over their last five games overall. The Bears\' offense showed new life under a new offensive coordinator in Sunday\'s loss to Green Bay as Chicago scored 19 points, after averaging just nine points over its previous three games. On defense, the Bears could also take advantage of a sloppy Vikings offense that has committed the fifth-most giveaways this season. Chicago has gone three straight games without turning the ball over and ranks third in the all-important stat of turnover differential (plus-nine). The advanced model from SportsLine has the Bears (+3.5) covering almost 60% of the time. See which other teams to pick here. Another one of its Week 12 NFL predictions: the Eagles (-3, 49) cover on the road versus the Rams on Sunday Night Football. Philadelphia has won seven of the last eight meetings with the Rams, and Philly rolls into this matchup with five straight road victories against the Rams. This season, Philadelphia boasts the best ATS road record in the league (5-1), its on a six-game winning streak straight-up, and the Eagles have covered in four of their last five games. Eagles receiver DeVonta Smith has been sidelined in practice this week with a hamstring injury. After having the second-worst pass defense last season, the Eagles have made a 180 and now are second-best in defending thru the air. That will make it tough for Los Angeles to move the ball because L.A. already ranks 30th in yards per rushing attempt and doesn\'t figure to find much success in the passing game versus Philly\'s stout defense. The Rams are also in the bottom eight in both third-down conversion percentage and redzone scoring. With these factors, the Eagles (-3) are forecasted to cover in well over 50% of simulations, with the model also saying the Under (48) hits over 50% of the time. See which other teams to pick here. How to make Week 12 NFL picks The model has also made the call on who wins and covers in every other game on the Week 12 NFL schedule and just revealed three coveted A-rated picks against the spread, potentially giving you a huge payday. You can only get every pick for every game at SportsLine. So what NFL picks can you make with confidence, and which three A-rated picks should you lock in now? Check out the latest NFL odds below, then visit SportsLine to see which teams win and cover the spread, all from a proven computer model that has returned well over $7,000, and find out.

Trump\'s latest Cabinet pick replaces Matt Gaetz, the former Florida representative and nominee for attorney general, who on Thursday withdrew as Trump\'s pick for the top prosecutor after the \"distraction\" his nomination had caused due to a swirl of allegations about paying underage women for sex. \"Pam was a prosecutor for nearly 20 years, where she was very tough on Violent Criminals, and made the streets safe for Florida Families,\" Trump wrote in his announcement. \"Then, as Florida’s first female Attorney General, she worked to stop the trafficking of deadly drugs, and reduce the tragedy of Fentanyl Overdose Deaths, which have destroyed many families across our Country. She did such an incredible job, that I asked her to serve on our Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission during my first Term — We saved many lives!
